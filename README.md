Learning application for the Japanese script of Hiragana.

## Creating a project

### Goals:  

Have an application that can be used by my daughter to start learning Hiragana.

### Possible Features:  

- Flippable cards to learn Hiragana. One side should display a gliph, the other side an image.
- Maybe it is possible to play a sound that reads the gliph/description of the image?
- Could also include a set of Katakana cards
- The project should be easily configurable
- The web app should be installable as a PWA on any mobile device

## Building

Run `npm run build`
